Name: Roy Vicerra (rvicerra)

Special Instructions: There are no special instructions.
			The Makefile includes "make all", "make mytalk",
			and "make clean". All three options are valid.

Extra Comments: This really was super fun to play around 
		with once it started working! The only error I
	        believe I have is that EOF is not caught while in 
		the window mode, though the exit signal is caught perfectly.
