Name: Roy Vicerra (rvicerra)

Special Instructions: There are no special instructions. 
	The Makefile includes "make all" and "make timeit".
	I included extra error messages for clarity.

Extra Comments: This lab was conceptually very fun! I enjoyed 
		how it is the same process as handling an
 		interrupt--I have been waiting for the past 6 
		weeks to learn it since you told me about it.
