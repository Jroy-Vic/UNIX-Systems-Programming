Name: Roy Vicerra (rvicerra)

Special Instructions: You can run "make all", "make mytar", "make clean"from the Makefile. The arguments are passed correctly, however I was only able to implement the Archive Create option.

Extra Comments: This program can only create a TAR. I implemented a printing debugger so at least you can see that it can properly create a TAR.
